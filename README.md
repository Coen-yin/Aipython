## 💡 Example Interactions

### Basic Conversations
```
You: Hello!
AI: Hello! I'm a custom AI system built from scratch in Python. How can I help you today?

You: What is machine learning?
AI: I understand you're asking about machine, learning. Let me analyze this based on my knowledge.
```

### Teaching the AI
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### Neural Network
The AI uses a custom-built neural network with:
- Xavier weight initialization
- ReLU activation for hidden layers
- Softmax activation for output layer
- Backpropagation training algorithm
- Cross-entropy loss function

### Knowledge Representation
Knowledge is stored in a graph structure where:
- Concepts are nodes with properties
- Relationships connect concepts
- Graph traversal finds related information
- Confidence scores weight knowledge reliability

### Memory Management
Two-tier memory system:
- **Short-term**: Recent interactions (100 items max)
- **Long-term**: Important memories (1000 items max)
- Automatic transfer based on importance scores
- Relevance-based recall using Jaccard similarity

### Reasoning Process
1. Extract key concepts from input
2. Retrieve relevant knowledge from graph
3. Apply inference rules pattern matching
4. Generate conclusions with confidence scores
5. Formulate response based on findings

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Dependencies
- `numpy`: For numerical computations and neural network operations
- `pickle`: For state serialization
- `re`: For pattern matching and text processing
- Standard Python libraries: `json`, `math`, `random`, `datetime`, `os`

### Neural Network Architecture
- Input layer: Variable size based on vocabulary
- Hidden layers: 2 layers with ReLU activation
- Output layer: Softmax for probability distribution
- Learning rate: 0.01 (configurable)

### Knowledge Base Schema
```python
KnowledgeNode {
    concept: str,
    properties: Dict[str, Any],
    connections: List[str],
    confidence: float
}
```

### Memory Structure
```python
Memory {
    type: str,
    content: str,
    importance: float,
    timestamp: datetime,
    relevance: float  # computed during recall
}
```
